# COS498_FinalPrj
This was the final project for COS498 - AI for Art and Design. It was developed using scikit-learn Naive Bayes
Multinomial Classifier and Google's pretrained word2vec model to predict sentiment and place of Maine
Standard Aquaculture Leases. Predictions are not validated in this code. This is just a conceptual implementation
that still needs a lot of work!
```
The following libraries are needed to run this code, I recommend installing miniconda:
Python 3.6 64-bit
conda create -n filename python=3
conda activate filename
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge pdfminer.six
conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge proj4
conda install -c conda-forge basemap=1.0.8.dev0
conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires
conda install pillow
conda install gensim
```
